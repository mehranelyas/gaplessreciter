Thanks a lot for such an amazing app
I created an app for android so everyone can create a gapless database of their favorite reciter.
Also I created few gapless reciter databases such as Abdul Rahman Jamal Aloosi , Sheykh Reza Mohammadian and more
Please add them to Quran for Android app

here is the app that you can create reciter database with it. everyone can create a gapless database with this app because it is very simple to use.

just copy your reciter audio files to /QuranFiles/Temp/ folder and go to the app and move the playing state of audio to the very first of the showing ayah and then click next aya button to go to next verses and again arrange the position and so on.

after arranging all of the quran reciter sura just zip the /QuranFiles/Temp/output.db file and send here with reciter full name and audio source like below
